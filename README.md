Adjacent Fragment Pager Sample
==============================

Demonstrates how to manage two fragments where portrait displays them in a `ViewPager` and landscape
displays them side-by-side.

Due the shenanigans performed by `FragmentPagerAdapter` we're forced to write a custom
`PagerAdapter` which handles the instances our selves.

This sample is very-much hard coded and specific to two pages. If you wanted something a bit more
robust and generalized it wouldn't be too much work to do so.
